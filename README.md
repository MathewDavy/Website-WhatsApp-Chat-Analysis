# WhatsApp-Chat-Analysis

This is a website I built in my spare time. 

The user uploads a csv file of their exported WhatsApp chat.

Statistics about the chat are calculated on the Express server and sent back to the React frontend to be rendered in tables.

The graphs were built using Vanilla Javascript
